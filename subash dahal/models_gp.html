<b>1)Introduction:-</b> <p>
Web development is a broad term of the work involved to create a website. It has been one of the important things to us . So to create websites the tools HTML/CSS has been used. It is traditional tools and also common skills to a people.  </p> 
So there are many types of tools which are found in these days to create a website. It helps to work more efficiently to the developers and designer. It is all related about to explore, challenge and lead to the learning process.

<div class="experience">
	<b>a)My Experience:- </b>
<p>Talking about my experience I have been just involved recently with HTML and CSS for just three months’. I am learning HTML to code and to design website with using CSS these days.  It has been one of the interesting things to learn in my lifeand has been extremely helpful for me. </p> 
I have some limited knowledge of HTML and CSS which can be less comfortable for manipulating.  But I have been improving by learning more things in Html and Css. I think it’s really important to learn how it works. They are just formatting languages, which are easy to learn for us.  Being a developer we will be able to communicate with great developers and will be able to learn man details about coding. We must understand the code properly while developing a website for great optimizations.  
 <p>I learned how to make responsive webpage while coding. It helps to change the website completely different and attractive for any devices to work. Before creating the website wireframe mockup is the most important thing to be known or made. Without knowing or creating the wireframe it will be very hard while we code because it helps to identify the class and tags easily.  </p>
By studying Html and Css I don’t think it’s too hard to learn.  If we can understand or learn the tags, it will be too easier to create the websites by coding. Studying the web development is one the great decision of my life.
